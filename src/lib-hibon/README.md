# HiBON library

**HiBON** stands for **H**ash **i**nvariant **B**inary **O**bject **N**otation.

HiBON is a data format for the Tagion Network. It is based on BSON, with some data formats added, and strict rules on key sorting, resulting in hash-invariance (same data always results in the same hash).
