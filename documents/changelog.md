# Changelog for week 36/37

**Hashgraph**
Event round uses higher function in order to avoid underflow when comparing mother & father rounds.
Several outdated tests were removed.

**Safer actors**
Fixed an oversight where actor message delegates were not checked to be @safe.

**Inputvalidator**
Updated the tests for the inputvalidator. 
Previous tests were underspecified and we now try to cover all paths. By sending, valid hirpcs, invalid Documents and invalid hirpcs.
The version flag for the regular socket implementation has been removed and we now only use NNG sockets.

**Event subscription**
Implemented an internal mechanism for subscribing to events via a topic in the system. Which makes it easier to develop tests that require to know the falsy states of a service. In the future it will be used to decide which events get sent out through the shell.

**HiBON**
Updated the documentation for HiBONJSON and provide samples in hibonutil for easier compatibillity testing.
ISO time is now the accepted time format in HiBONJSON as opposed to SDT time

**CRYPTO**
Random generators are seeded with the hardware random functions provided by the OS.

**Epoch Creator**
The epoch creator is the service that drives the hashgraph. 
It's implemented using a shared address-book and tested in mode-0.
The address-book avoids burried state which was a source of several problems previosly when bootstrapping the network.

**DART Service**
The DART service has been implemented and CRUD operations tested. 
The service allows several services to access the DART.

**OLD TRANSACTION**
The code for the old transaction mechanism has been seperated and moved in to the prior services. This means that the code lives seperately and the OLD_TRANSACTION version flag has been removed.



# Changelog for week 34/35

**NNG**
We have implemented the worker pool capability for REQ-REP socket in NNG. A worker pool allows us to handle incoming requests concurrently and efficiently.

**Actor services**
We have created a way to make request reply style requests in our Actor Service. This provides a better way for ex. when a service needs to read data from the DART and make sure the data is sent back to the correct Tid. It also includes an unique ID, meaning you could wait for a certain request to happen.

**Gossipnet in mode0**
We have changed the gossipnet in mode0 to use our adressbook for finding valid channels to communicate over. This implementation is more robust than the earlier one which required a sequential startup.

**WASM testing**
We have implemented a BDD for the i32 files to BetterC. It is created in a way so that it supports all the other files which means further transpiling will become easier.

**HashGraph**
The HashGraph implementation is done. This means the Hashgraph testing, re-definitions, implementation, optimisation and refactoring of the main algorithms are completed. The optimisation potential in Hashgraph, Wavefront and ordering algorithms and implementations are endless, but we have a stable and performing asynchronous BFT mechanism. Soon we will optimize the ordering definitions (Though they are working now) and add mechanical functionality for swapping.



# Changelog for week 33/34

**NNG**
We've completed the implementation of asynchronous calls in NNG -Aio, which enhances our system's responsiveness with non-blocking IO capabilities. The integration of NNG into our services has begun, starting with the inputvalidator.

**Build flows**
Our Android build-flows have been refined to compile all components into a single binary, enabling uniform use of a mobile library across the team. This optimisation is achieved through a matrix-run process in GitHub Actions.

**WASM Transpiling**
We can now transpile Wast i32 files to BetterC and automatically convert test specifications into unit tests. This advancement enables comprehensive testing of transpiled BetterC files.

**Hashgraph**
We've improved epoch flexibility in the Hashgraph, aligning with last week's adjustments to "famous" and "witness" definitions. It leads to events ending in epochs earlier, allowing for faster consensus.
